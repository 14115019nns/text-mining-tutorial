If you go to the following link, you can download a Virtual Machine which you can load into Oracle's free software, VM Virtualbox Manager. This is basically a way of working with two different computers, with different operating systems, on 1 computer. You won't have to change anything on your current machine aside from installing the Oracle software. The VM is preloaded with Anaconda, GSL and Stephen's LDA module.
